                        Cho Seung-youn (Korean: 조승연, born August 5, 1996), known professionally as Woodz (stylized in all caps), is a South Korean singer-songwriter, rapper, dancer, and record producer. He first rose to fame as the main rapper and sub-vocalist of South Korean-Chinese boy band Uniq, formed by Yuehua Entertainment in 2014. He co-founded the musical collectives M.O.L.A in 2015 and Drinkcolor in 2016. In 2018, he co-founded his personal production team, Team HOW.

                        Following an appearance on the fifth season of the South Korean rap competition show Show Me the Money, Woodz debuted as a solo artist under the stage name Luizy in July 2016, with the release of the collaborative hip-hop single "Recipe". He subsequently changed his stage name to Woodz in 2018, reflecting changes in musical direction. His releases as Woodz, including the singles "Pool", "Different", and "meaningless", delved into alternative R&B and featured Woodz transitioning from rap to vocals. In addition to his solo work, he has written and produced songs for artists in both his native South Korea and China, as well as for the shows The Unit: Idol Rebooting Project and Idol Producer.

He debuted with X1 under Swing Entertainment in August 2019.

                            Cho Seung-youn was born on August 5, 1996, in Seoul, South Korea.[1] Raised as an only child, his parents both worked as business people: his mother owned a Chinese restaurant in Cheongdam-dong as well as a travel agency in Sinsa-dong, both in the Gangnam district of Seoul; while his father owned a Korean restaurant in the Philippines.[2] Due to his family's business obligations, he often moved during his childhood.[3]

                            Initially intending to pursue a professional career in association football, Woodz was accepted into the youth development system of Campeonato Brasileiro Série A club Sport Club Corinthians Paulista and moved to Brazil during his final year of elementary school,[4][5][6] where he resided in the São Paulo municipalities of Penápolis and Santos.[7] As a teenager, he played as a main striker for Sport Club Corinthians Paulista's junior affiliate team for two years;[5][8] as is customary for Brazilian football players, he adopted a Portuguese mononym, Luizinho.[9] He later attended Reedley International School in Manila, Philippines, for one year to learn English.[3][10][11]

                            Growing up, Woodz was not fond of urban music, such as K-pop, and primarily listened to Korean ballad.[12] However, when Woodz began to experience homesickness while studying abroad, he turned to watching episodes of the South Korean music program Music Bank in order to cope.[6] Inspired by the song "Let's Go On a Vacation" by Lee Seung-gi,[13][14] he returned to South Korea to pursue a musical career.[15] He enrolled in Hanlim Multi Art School in the Practical Dance Department but started one year late due to his time overseas.[3][16] After graduating from Hanlim in 2016,[17] he was admitted to Dong-ah Institute of Media and Arts' Division of Entertainment in Broadcasting.[3][18] He later transferred to Global Cyber University [ko], enrolling in the Department of Entertainment and Media.[19]

                                Woodz auditioned more than 50 times to various entertainment companies, such as SM Entertainment and JYP Entertainment, before being accepted as a trainee at YG Entertainment.[20] He had been training at YG for one and a half years before he joined the UNIQ pre-debut team.[15][20][21] UNIQ, a multinational collaboration managed by Yuehua Entertainment, had its members cooperatively trained by both Chinese company Yuehua and South Korean company YG in the lead up to their official debut in both countries.[22][23] Woodz's first public appearance with UNIQ was on October 16, 2014, when the group performed on the music program M Countdown.[24] The group's debut single "Falling in Love", recorded in both Mandarin and Korean, was released in both China and South Korea four days later on October 20.[25][26] Their first mini album EOEO, also recorded in both Mandarin and Korean, was released in both countries on April 24, 2015.[27][28]

                                As the group's main rapper and sub-vocalist,[29] Cho was involved in UNIQ's musical direction from their debut, penning his own rap verses as well as other lyrics for their Korean releases.[30][31] When UNIQ's Korean promotions as a full group became more infrequent starting in the latter half of 2015 due to rising political tensions between China and South Korea,[32] other members of the group began engaging in individual activities, such as acting;[33] however, Woodz opted not to follow this career route, expressing a desire to focus on the musical aspect of his career.[34][35] On August 14, 2015, the formation of the musical collective M.O.L.A was announced via the release of the song "My Way" on YouTube,[36] featuring Woodz as one of its founding members alongside 15&'s Park Ji-min and producer NATHAN.[37] Three more members—Pentagon's Kino, Seventeen's Vernon, and guitarist Hoho—later joined the collective.[38]

                                In 2016, Woodz applied to participate in the rap competition show Show Me the Money 5; he had previously applied for the show's fourth season but was unable to participate due to conflicts with Uniq's EOEO promotions.[39] Although eliminated in the early rounds of the show, he drew positive attention from its viewership.[40] After his appearance on Show Me the Money 5, he went on to co-found the production crew Drinkcolor alongside fellow producers EDEN, ODDTOM, and M.O.L.A member NATHAN on July 26, 2016.[41] Woodz then made his solo debut under the stage name Luizy three days later on July 29, with the self-produced hip-hop single "Recipe", a collaboration with fellow Show Me the Money 5 competitor Flowsik.[35] He co-wrote the track with Flowsik, with whom he had struck up a friendship during the show's run.[34] Following this, he released his first single as sole lead artist, "Baby Ride", on August 14, 2016; the title track featured BtoB member Im Hyun-sik.[42] Cho collaborated with Im again in March 2017 for his first participation in an OST as a soloist with the single "Eating Alone", included on the OST for the music variety show Sing For You.[43] Six months later, he made his first appearance as a featured artist on Lee Gi-kwang's song "Dream".[44]

"Always" would then be featured on the survival show The Unit: Idol Rebooting Project in January 2018, where it was performed by the unit Blossom and released as a digital single as part of the show's fourth mission.[47][48] This was Woodz's first time producing a track for another artist; it also marked a brief transitional period in which he ceased using the name Luizy, as he was instead credited under his legal name for "Always".

                            As a solo artist, Woodz has been involved in writing all of his lyrics and producing most of his music. In the early stages of his career, Woodz's musical style gravitated towards hip hop,[99] with his releases under the name Luizy also incorporating pop and electronic music.[12] However, the change of his stage name as a soloist to Woodz in 2018 was accompanied by a change in musical direction,[100] described by Status Magazine as an "[evolution] into a more realized identity".[12] As opposed to his "poppier" approach as Luizy, Woodz characterizes his production style under the Woodz name as "mostly [...] R&B", but mentions that he is "not picky about the genre".[12] Commentators have also noted his experimentation with genres,[3][60] with his music as Woodz being identified as possessing elements of alternative R&B, atmospheric music, and dream pop while retaining a "signature climatic sound".[12][59][65] In a further artistic contrast to his early career, which featured him primarily as a rapper, his releases as Woodz feature Woodz primarily as a vocalist. In retrospect, Woodz described the difference between his personas as a "matter of maturity", with the change to the more "mature" Woodz identity allowing him to distance himself from his "comparatively young" and immature identity as Luizy.[12]

                            Woodz's songs have featured a variety of concepts and themes; "Recipe", released shortly after his elimination from Show Me the Money 5, was noted to express "ambition" and defiance in the face of public scrutiny,[101] while "Baby Ride" was characterized as a "cool, cheerful" song that helps listeners "escape the midsummer heat".[42] Contrasting aspects of love and relationships were often the themes of his subsequent releases as Woodz: "Pool" was described by Status Magazine as a "gleeful", "jubilant love song";[12] whereas his follow-up single "Different" explored coming to terms with a break-up due to mutual incompatibility, with Maeil Business Newspaper writing that the song's lyrics are a "direct expression of the word 'different'".[60] Compared to his previous work, however, Woodz's third single as Woodz, "Meaningless", was described as a "darker" record that tackles more personal and "existential" themes; critics also noted that the song discussed his mental health, a topic that is often considered taboo in South Korea.[12] Woodz has referred to "meaningless" as akin to his "diary".[102]
